# Tech Stack for the Client/Server Network Project

This document outlines the technologies used in the development of the client/server network application, including links to their documentation.

## Programming and Serialization

- **Python**  
  The primary programming language used for this project.  
  [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)

- **Pickle**  
  Used for serializing and deserializing Python object structures (binary format).  
  [Pickle Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)

## Networking

- **Python SocketIO**  
  Enables real-time communication between the client and the server.  
  [Python SocketIO Documentation](https://python-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html)

## User Interface

- **Streamlit**  
  Used to create the user interface for the client application, allowing for easy interaction and visualization.  
  [Streamlit Documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/)
  [Streamlit API Reference for App Testing](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/app-testing)

## Security

- **Cryptography**  
  Provides cryptographic recipes and primitives to work with encryption and decryption of data.  
  [Cryptography Documentation](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/)

## Testing

- **unittest**  
  Built-in Python framework used for testing the Python code.  
  [unittest Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)

- **Streamlit App Test**  
  A tool for writing integration tests between the UI and the backend.
  [Streamlit App test](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/app-testing)

- **Coverage**  
  A tool for measuring the effectiveness of tests, checking how many lines of your code are executed while the tests run.  
  [Coverage Documentation](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.5.1/)

## Version Control

- **GitHub**  
  Hosts the repository and tracks all version control changes, allowing for collaborative code reviews and management.  
  [GitHub](https://github.com/)

## Commit Conventions

- **Conventional Commits**  
  A specification for adding human and machine readable meaning to commit messages.  
  [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
